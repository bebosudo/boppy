Maximum simulation time: 100

# TODO: handle multiple algorithms at once.
Simulation: SSA

Observables:
  - tot = x + y

Properties:
  x_s: 43

# The number of times the algorithm has to be repeated (useful for stochastic simulations)
Algorithm iterations: 1000

# The number of processes to use to consume the requested number of iterations.
# <= 0 means that will be used an amount of processes equal to the number of cores available.
Number of processes: -1
